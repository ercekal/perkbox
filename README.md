$ npm start
```

## Brief

Timed: 1 hour

Create the small test job capture application from the interview. The screenshots have been included in this zip.

We are just looking for the component markup and structure.

*We are **NOT** looking for logic or state management is required. Styling is also not important, react-bootstrap has been included in this project.*


## Extra
***Only do this if you complete the first task in time and are happy with it. Not doing this task will not impact negatively on your test.***

There is a todo list tab with a (very) basic to do list. Improve it however you feel best.


## Submission

Re-zip the file and email it back (tip: don't include the node_modules folder!)
